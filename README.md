# My First PHP Project

Welcome to my first PHP project! This simple project demonstrates the basics of PHP integration within an HTML file. In this project, you'll find a header with a title, some PHP-generated messages, and a footer.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone or download this repository to your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a web server environment set up on your local machine to run PHP files. You can use tools like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP for this purpose.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Open the `index.php` file in your preferred code editor.

4. Start your local web server.

5. View the project in your web browser by accessing `http://localhost/path/to/your/project`.

## Usage

Once the project is set up and running, you'll see the header with the title "My First PHP Project". Below the header, you'll find two PHP-generated messages enclosed in `<div>` tags with the class `message`. These messages demonstrate how to output dynamic content using PHP within an HTML file. Finally, there's a footer at the bottom of the page displaying the creator's name.
